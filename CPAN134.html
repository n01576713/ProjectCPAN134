    <p>CPAN134 is a course that offers a general understanding of web programming and design. It covers the technical aspects of interface development and teaches the essential skills required to create user friendly and interactive web interfaces. As we progress throughout the course, I along with others will incorporate CSS and JavaScript into our knowledge of HTML5, allowing us to enhance our web development skills and improve this portfolio throughout the semester.
        During the first week of the course, we had a detailed discussion on the history of the internet, including the milestones and technology advancements that have contributed to its growth. We learned about the importance of HTML in constructing web pages and how to structure an HTML5 document to enhance usability and navigation. We will continue to build on our knowledge of HTML throughout the course.
        The course also covers the creation of tables and forms, and we learned about their purposes and how to build them. We were taught how to build forms, including how to validate them and ensure that user inputs are accurate. With this knowledge it can help use create more user friendly pages that are clean and efficient.
